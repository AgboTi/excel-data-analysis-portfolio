# 🏦 Bank Customer Churn Analysis

This project analyzes customer churn patterns using Excel dashboards. The dataset includes 10,000 bank customers, and the goal is to identify key attributes associated with customer attrition. Two interactive dashboards are built using Pivot Tables, Charts, and Slicers to explore the data visually.

## 📁 Project Structure

---

- `Dashboards/` — Contains visual snapshots of the interactive Excel dashboards.
- `Report/` — Contains the final project case study in Word format.

---

## 📊 Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (Power Query, Pivot Tables, Slicers, Grouping, Charts)
- Microsoft Word (for documentation)

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Middle-aged** customers had the highest churn (1,057), followed by **young adults** (538).
- Customers with **credit cards** churn more (1,424) than those without (613).
- **Medium and high balance** customers are more likely to churn (746 each).
- **Germany** had the highest churn (814), followed by **France** (810).
- **Intermediate tenure** customers had the highest churn (625), while loyal customers churned the least.

## 🧠 What This Project Shows

- Use of Excel for interactive dashboarding.
- Ability to derive clear business insights from data.
- Structured, well-documented analysis with professional presentation.
- Awareness of **limitations** in descriptive-only datasets.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

The dataset lacks behavioral or feedback-related variables. Therefore, this project answers *who is churning*, but **not why**.

Future analysis could benefit from:
- Customer satisfaction scores (e.g., NPS)
- Complaint or support history
- Survey or exit feedback
- Time-based engagement metrics
